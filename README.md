# CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training)

This repository provides an overview of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model and includes a Jupyter notebook (`demo.ipynb`) that demonstrates its functionality.

## Overview

CLIP is a neural network trained on a variety of (image, text) pairs. It can be used to perform tasks such as zero-shot image classification, where it is not necessary to fine-tune the model on a specific dataset. CLIP leverages a contrastive learning approach to jointly train an image encoder and a text encoder to predict the correct pairings of a batch of (image, text) examples.

## Architecture

The CLIP model consists of two main components:

1. **Image Encoder**: This component processes images and converts them into a fixed-size feature vector. Common architectures used for the image encoder include ResNet and Vision Transformers (ViT).

2. **Text Encoder**: This component processes text and converts it into a fixed-size feature vector. The text encoder is typically based on transformer architectures like the one used in GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

### Training Process

The training process of CLIP involves the following steps:
- **Data Preparation**: Collect a large dataset of (image, text) pairs.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use the image encoder to extract feature vectors for images and the text encoder to extract feature vectors for texts.
- **Contrastive Loss**: Apply a contrastive loss function to maximize the similarity of correct (image, text) pairs and minimize the similarity of incorrect pairs.

### Inference

During inference, the trained image and text encoders can be used to:
- **Zero-shot Classification**: Predict the label of an image by comparing its feature vector with the feature vectors of text descriptions of potential labels.
- **Image Retrieval**: Find the image that best matches a given text description by comparing their feature vectors.
- **Text Retrieval**: Find the text description that best matches a given image by comparing their feature vectors.

## Demo

The `demo.ipynb` notebook provides an interactive demonstration of the CLIP model's capabilities. It includes examples of zero-shot image classification, image retrieval, and text retrieval using pre-trained CLIP models.

### Running the Demo
